Semester Project Proposal

Objective:
Design and implement an advanced system in C++ that replicates core functionalities found in popular applications such as Canvas (educational platforms), banking systems, or administrative profile managers.

Semester Project Proposal: In this phase, you need to build your team of a maximum of two members and submit the description of your project along with the empathy path. 

Background:
In the real world, software systems are designed to perform various tasks efficiently. This project aims to emulate such systems by allowing you to choose a domain of interest and then develop a program with functional depth, showcasing your understanding of C++.

Project Requirements:

Domain Selection:
You can select one of the following domains or propose another domain of your choice:

Educational Platform (e.g., Canvas)
Banking System
Administrative Profile Manager (e.g., HR system, University Admissions)
Core Functionalities:
Depending on the domain selected, the system must include, but is not limited to, the following functionalities:

Educational Platform (Canvas-like)

User Registration (Instructor, Student)
Course Creation & Enrollment
Assignment Submission & Grading
Forums or Discussion Boards
Banking System

Account Creation (Checking, Savings)
Fund Transfer & Transactions
Account Statements
Loan Application & Approval System
Alerts for Low Balance, Unusual Activity, etc.
Administrative Profile Manager

Profile Creation & Modification
Role-based Access (Admin, User, Guest)
Data Retrieval & Reporting
Search & Filter Functionalities
Notifications & Alerts
Object-Oriented Design:
Implement the system using object-oriented principles. The program should have a clear structure with classes. 

Error Handling:
Your system should be robust and handle possible errors. This includes data validation, handling incorrect user inputs, and managing system exceptions.

User Interface:
Develop a clear and interactive user interface. This can be a command-line interface or, if you are comfortable, a basic graphical user interface using C++ libraries like Qt.

Documentation:
Maintain a well-documented codebase with comments explaining crucial sections. Include a separate document (or README) detailing how to use the system, its functionalities, and any assumptions made during development.

Evaluation Criteria:

Code structure and use of object-oriented principles.
Implementation of core functionalities.
Error handling and system robustness.
Clarity and efficiency of the user interface.
Quality of documentation.
Tips:
Before diving into coding, spend time planning. Sketch out the system architecture, decide on the classes you'll need, and consider the user flow within the application. Testing the application regularly as you build will ensure the final product is both functional and user-friendly.
